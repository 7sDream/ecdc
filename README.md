# ECDC

The Encode/Decode (ecdc) extension allows you to quickly convert one or more selections of text to and from various formats. Supported conversions include:

* String to Base64
* Base 64 to String
* String to JSON Byte Array
* Base64 to JSON Byte Array
* String to MD5 Hash (as Base64 String)

## How to Use

The extension provides a single command to the command palette. To active the command simply launch the command palette (`Shift-CMD-P` on OSX or `Shift-Ctrl-P` on Windows and Linux), then just type `Convert Selection`, then a menu of possible conversions will be displayed.
