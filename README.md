# ECDC

The Encode/Decode (ecdc) extension allows you to quickly convert multiple selections of text to and from **base64** format. In the future we'll support other transformations.

## How to Use

The extension provides two commands to the command palette. To active the command simply launch the command palette (`Shift-CMD-P` on OSX or `Shift-Ctrl-P` on Windows and Linux). Then just type `Encode Selection` or `Decode Selection` to find the appropriate command.
